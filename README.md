## 🎨 How It Works

1. The `data` object in `abc.js` maps each letter to:
   - `name`: Word (e.g., Apple)
   - `sound`: Audio file path
   - `photo`: Image file path

2. On click or keypress:
   - Audio plays
   - Image drops from top using CSS animation

3. Images are styled with `.apple-img` class and animated via `@keyframes dropApple`.
